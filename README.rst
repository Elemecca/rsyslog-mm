`Rsyslog`_ is an excellent `syslog`_ server used by default in many Linux
distributions. Written in C, it's faster, more efficient, and generally more
reliable than the larger, more featureful log forwarders. Unfortunately its
documentation is both sparse and often wrong, especially for the older
7.x release series preferred by distributions.

This is an attempt by a third party to address that flaw by providing a complete
and accurate manual. The information presented in this manual comes primarily
from reading the Rsyslog source code. This documentation project is not
affiliated with Rainer Gerhards or the Rsyslog project.
