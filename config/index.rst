Configuration
*************

Since version 6, Rsyslog is configured in a simple procedural language called
RainerScript whose syntax should seem familiar to users of any language in the C
extended family. The elements of the classic ``syslogd`` configuration format
are carried forward as statements in RainerScript, so configuration files for
``syslogd`` or ``sysklogd`` should work in Rsyslog without modification.
